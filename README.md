- **Contact Panel**: Center-bottom section with social links
- **Projects Panel**: Right column showing GitHub repositories
- **Typing Animation**: Center section with rotating text phrases

## üìù How Articles Are Written and Managed

### Writing Articles

1. **Create Markdown File**: Write your article in Markdown format and save it in the `blog-posts/` directory
   ```markdown
   # Article Title
   
   Your article content goes here...
   ```

2. **Add Article Metadata**: Update `config/articles.json` with your article information:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "Your Article Title",
     "summary": "Brief description of the article",
     "markdown": "/blog-posts/your-article.md",
     "image": "/images/blog/your-image.jpg",
     "objectPosition": "center 50%",
     "tags": ["Tag1", "Tag2"]
   }
   ```

### Article Configuration

- **`title`**: Display name for the article
- **`summary`**: Brief description shown in the article list
- **`markdown`**: Path to the Markdown file (relative to the website root)
- **`image`**: Path to the hero image for the article
- **`objectPosition`**: CSS object-position for image cropping (e.g., "center 75%")
- **`tags`**: Array of predefined tags for categorization

### Adding Images

Place article images in the `images/blog/` directory and reference them in the article metadata. The `objectPosition` property allows you to control how images are cropped and displayed.

## üè∑Ô∏è Tag System

Tags are predefined in `config/config.json` and provide categorization and filtering for articles.

### Tag Configuration

Each tag includes:
- **`color`**: CSS class name for styling
- **`description`**: Tooltip text explaining the tag's purpose

### Available Tags

The current tag system includes:
- **Security**: Cybersecurity and privacy topics
- **Coding**: Programming and software development
- **AI**: Artificial intelligence and machine learning
- **Tutorial**: Step-by-step guides and how-to content
- **Project**: Personal and professional projects
- **Intro**: Blog introductions and personal journey
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
- **Home Lab**: Home lab setup and experiments
- **Systems Integration**: Integration and automation topics
- **Life**: Personal reflections and experiences

### Adding New Tags

1. Add the tag definition to `config/config.json`:
   ```json
   "YourTag": {
     "color": "your-color-class",
     "description": "Description of what this tag represents"
   }
   ```

2. Add corresponding CSS styling for the color class in `index.html`

## üìä Article Order

Articles are displayed in the order they appear in the `config/articles.json` array. The most recent or featured articles should be placed at the beginning of the array for prominence.

To reorder articles:
1. Open `config/articles.json`
2. Rearrange the article objects in your desired display order
3. Save the file - changes will be reflected immediately
