# A Quick Reality Check

> *You must give up the life you have planned, so you can have the life that is waiting for you.* - **Joseph Campbell**

Recently, a lot in my life has changed. I've been working towards my *b.s* degree and a month before graduation, I've received an amazing opportunity to work as a Software Engineer at T-Mobile. Amazing! I have been very happy to be able to work with such a talented team and learn from them at all opportunities I have had. It has been truly a dream come true in a way.

At the same time, I have been able to get my own place and finally have a place to call my own, until my lease ends. However, this has been the things that I have been working towards for the past years and, the fact that I have been able to achieve this has been a great feeling.

To give a sense of how much things changed, in less than a month, I have had a job change + a new place to live + (in a few days) finished my degree. Things have been moving very fast and I couldn't be happier with the way things are going.

However, like my mother always told me: *if you want something new, you have to let something old go*. And man, how true that is. Even if you don't want to and fight to keep it, life just finds a way to make you let go, no *buts* or *ifs*.

Today, I have gone to a *Festa Junina*, a traditional party from Brazil that happens every June. I haven't been to one since high school and, looking at the traditions, dances, music that I once thought to be corny or annoying, got my eyes watery. I remember not enjoying this event but, somehow, I was incredibly happy to be part of it, embrace it and share that moment with the people around me.

I am not sure if this is me growing up or if I am just starting to see life for what it is, a truly special and unique thing. There is no predetermined path, I have to embrace my own story because that's what makes me unique and, because of it, I add to the table.

Q2 2024 is a quarter for the books. So much has happened and I am having fun with it.
