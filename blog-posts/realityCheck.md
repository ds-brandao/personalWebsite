# A Quick Reality Check

> *You must give up the life you have planned, so you can have the life that is waiting for you.* - **Joseph Campbell**

Recently, my life has changed a lot. I’ve been working toward my bachelor's degree, and just one month before graduating, I landed an amazing job as a Software Engineer at T-Mobile. It’s honestly been fantastic! I'm super thankful to be working alongside such talented people and learning as much as possible—it feels like a dream come true.

At the same time, I finally got my own place. Having my own space, at least until the lease ends, feels amazing. These are milestones I've been chasing for years, and reaching them feels incredibly satisfying.

To give you an idea of how fast things moved: in less than a month, I've switched jobs, moved into a new home, and I'll be finishing my degree soon. Everything’s happened so quickly, and I'm really happy with how things are turning out.

But as my mom always says, "If you want something new, you have to let go of something old." That’s never felt more true. Even if you try to hold onto things, life always pushes you forward—no "ifs" or "buts."

Today I went to a *Festa Junina*, a traditional Brazilian festival held every June. It was my first time attending since high school, and surprisingly, seeing all the traditions, dances, and music that I used to find cheesy actually got me emotional. Even though I didn't appreciate it before, today I genuinely enjoyed being there, soaking it all in, and sharing the experience with others.

I don’t know if this means I'm growing up or just starting to really appreciate life’s special moments. I've realized there’s no set path in life, and my unique journey is what makes me, well, me.

May 2025 will be a month for the books, and I'm having a great time living it.
