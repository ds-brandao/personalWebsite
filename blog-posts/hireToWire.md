# The importance of synchronizing

One of the biggest challenges I have faced early in my career was the lack of synchronization between the HR and the IT systems, a crucial aspect for any organization to flow smoothly whenever a new employee joins or leaves the company.

In organizations where the HR and IT systems are not synchronized, it is very common to see a lot of manual work to onboard a new employee and to offboard an exiting one. This not only increases the time it takes to onboard a new employee but also increases the risk of errors, which can be costly for the organization when it comes to compliance and security.

## Systems blind to each other

A system is effectively “blind” to the other when there is no integration between them—no mechanism to automatically communicate key events such as a new hire, a role change, or a termination.

In such environments, IT teams are often dependent on manual tickets submitted by managers or HR staff to trigger account provisioning or deactivation. This manual chain introduces multiple points of failure: incorrect information, delays in communication, or missed events altogether - causing last minute rushes to get the job done.

From an IT perspective, this disconnect creates a constant game of catch-up. Teams are forced to react to personnel changes without having real-time visibility into them. This not only wastes time but creates an unnecessary burden that can be mitigated with proper synchronization.

This problem is rooted in the lack of a inter-department communication, both departments are working in silos and not properly aligned with each other from the beginning when implementing new HCM systems like ADP, UKG, etc.

## A culture problem or a lack of direction?

In many organizations, the lack of synchronization is often mistakenly seen as a purely technical issue. But more often than not, it’s a cultural one — a reflection of how departments view collaboration, accountability, and shared ownership of business processes.

When IT and HR operate in silos, it’s usually because there’s no overarching directive aligning their efforts. HR may focus solely on compliance and employee lifecycle management, while IT prioritizes system uptime, access control, and infrastructure security. Without a shared strategy, integration efforts fall through the cracks.

What’s needed is executive buy-in and cross-functional alignment — a clear mandate that these systems must not only coexist but actively support each other. Leadership needs to recognize that identity management starts the moment a person is hired, not when a ticket is finally filed.

This cultural gap is further reinforced when organizations choose new HCM or IAM platforms without involving both IT and HR in the selection and design process. Tools like Workday, BambooHR, ADP, or UKG have powerful APIs and integration features, but they often go underutilized because neither team has the clarity — or the incentive — to own the integration process.

## The power of *event-driven* architecture

To address this problem effectively, modern organizations are moving towards event-driven architecture for employee lifecycle management. Instead of relying on human-triggered tickets, systems listen for events like:

- A new hire being added in the HR system
- A promotion or department transfer
- A termination or leave of absence

These events can trigger automated workflows in IT systems: provisioning accounts, assigning the right permissions, enrolling devices, and even triggering onboarding flows for third-party SaaS tools.

By leveraging APIs and event-based triggers, organizations create a responsive environment where changes in one system cascade automatically to others. This significantly reduces the manual burden and closes the feedback loop between HR and IT.
